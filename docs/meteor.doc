# gongo vs Meteor

To be clear, the concept and data flow is very similar to Meteor.  I spent
years working with Meteor and have a lot of love for the team and community.

If, for whatever reason, you choose not to use Meteor for a particular project,
this package aims to return the joyful developer experience to creating apps
while addressing some of the shortcomings.

## Issues

What are some issues this package should address? (WIP)

* Performance (server)
 * mongodb changestreams
 * allow for serverless / lambda architecture
 * dont cover all cases, only performant ones.
   * don't keep track of what clients have in memory

* Performance (client)
 * Make reactivity opt-in / more explicit
 * Batch incoming data

* Offline support
 * Offline-first support via indexeddb.

* Security
 * Address allow/deny issues
